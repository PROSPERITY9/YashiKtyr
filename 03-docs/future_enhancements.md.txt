# Future Enhancements
The current MPIN Validator is robust and modular. However,on giving it some more time after gaining relevant experience I think  it can be extended significantly to boost security, usability, and real-time intelligence.

## 1. Expand Demographic Data Checks

Enhance validation by including more personal data sources:

- **Favorite Numbers** â€” Users often choose numbers like their lucky number.
- **Family Birthdays** â€” Birth dates of parents, children, or siblings.
- **Address Elements** â€” House numbers or ZIP codes frequently appear in weak MPINs.

** Goal**: Improve accuracy by catching more personal and predictable PINs.

## 2.  Machine Learning Integration( The most intersting thing I would like to work on.)

Use AI to predict and prevent weak PINs:

- Train models on historical patterns of weak MPINs.
- Learn from real user behavior to flag risky choices.
- Continuously evolve using feedback and data.

** Goal**: Predict vulnerabilities and adapt to emerging threat trends.

## 3. Real-time Feedback

Help users pick strong MPINs during setup:

- Instantly notify users if the MPIN is weak.
- Offer suggestions for strong alternatives.
- Use visual indicators (color, strength meter).

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal**: Guide users proactively during MPIN creation.

## 4. ðŸ“± Mobile Application Support

Make the MPIN validator available as a mobile app:

- Let users check PIN strength while setting up mobile banking like autosuggestion we get by google keyboard while setting passwords on website.
- Add real-time validation with intuitive feedback (colors, alerts).
- Allow banks to integrate this into onboarding flows.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal**: Provide secure, on-the-go MPIN validation.
